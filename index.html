#
# Enter the details of your project here, as a series of stanzas describing
# options, tasks, and so forth.  Each stanza starts with a line telling what
# it is describing, followed by a number of settings.
#
# Tasks look like this (where all of the settings are optional):
#
# task electrical:
#   title: Electrical
#   duration: 2
#   before: drywall
#   after: framing
#
# Each task has a name, which is how other tasks will refer to it.  It can also have
# a title, which will be displayed in the diagram.  Its duration is given in days, and
# 'after' and 'before' are used to describe its relationship to other tasks.
#
# Now, delete these comments and get started!
